# Inferential Statistics
- Inferential statistics involves using data from a sample to make generalizations or inferences about a population.
- Unlike descriptive statistics, which only summarize the data, inferential statistics allow us to make predictions, test hypotheses, and estimate population parameters.
- Key concepts in inferential statistics include point estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and various statistical tests.

## Point estimation and confidence intervals
- Point Estimation: A point estimate is a single value given as an estimate of an unknown population parameter. For example, the sample mean x' is used as a point estimate for the population mean Î¼.
- Confidence Interval (CI): A confidence interval provides a range of values within which a population parameter is expected to lie, with a certain level of confidence. The interval is calculated from the sample data and typically expressed as:
