# Mind Map

# Introduction
- Linear Regression is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables)
- One Independent Variable - Linear Regression
- More than one Independent variable is multiple linear regression
- When the dependent variable is dependent on the Independent variable with different powers is polynomial regression

## Assumptions of Linear Regression
1. **Linearity:** The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable must be linear. For each change in an independent variable, the change in the dependent variable is proportional.
2. **Independence:** Observations should be independent of each other. No observation should influence another, which ensures that residuals (errors) are not correlated.
3. **Homoscedasticity:** The variance of errors should remain constant across all values of the independent variable(s). This means that residuals should be spread equally and randomly.
4. **Multicollinearity:** Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. If the independent variables are correlated, it becomes difficult to distinguish their individual effects on the dependent variable.
5. **Normal Distribution of Errors:** The errors (residuals) of the model should follow a normal distribution. This ensures that predictions are reliable and can be generalized.

- Practical:- Action: Learn how to check these assumptions using diagnostic plots such as residual plots, scatterplots, and correlation matrices.
