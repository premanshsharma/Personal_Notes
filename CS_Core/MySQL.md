- SQL is a standard query language
- SQL keywords are not case sensitive, select is the same as SELECT
- ; at the end of every statement is required.
- COMMENTS: Can be added using -- for single-line comments or /* ... */ for multi-line comments.

# Mind Map
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
  - defines the structure of db, including creating, altering & dropping tables. 
  - CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  - DML commands query, insert, update, and delete data in db.
  - SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
  - INSERT INTO: Adds new records to a table.
  - UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
  - DELETE: Removes records from a table.
  - INSERT SELECT: Inserts data returned by a SELECT query into a table.
  - NULL VALUES: Refers to inserting or handling NULL values in a table.
  - LIMIT: Limits the number of records returned by a SELECT statement.
- Data Query Language (DQL)
  - SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables (also listed under DML because it is part of data manipulation).
  - WHERE: Filters rows based on a specified condition.
  - ORDER BY: Sorts the result set by one or more columns.
  - GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "count" or "average."
  - HAVING: Filters groups formed by GROUP BY based on a condition.
  - MIN, MAX, COUNT, AVG, SUM: Aggregate functions used with GROUP BY or in standalone queries to calculate minimum, maximum, count, average, or sum of values.
- Data Control Language (DCL)
  - DCL commands are used for permissions and access control to data and objects.
- Clauses
  - WHERE: Filters records based on a condition.
  - AND, OR, NOT: Logical operators used in filtering conditions.
  - IN: Checks if a value matches any value in a list or subquery.
  - BETWEEN: Filters results within a range of values.
  - LIKE: Searches for a specified pattern in a column.
  - WILDCARDS: Used in conjunction with LIKE to represent one or more unspecified characters (e.g., %, _).
  - EXISTS: Checks if a subquery returns any results.
  - ANY, ALL: Used with subqueries to compare a value to a set of values returned by a subquery.
- Operators
  - OPERATORS: General term for operators like arithmetic (+, -, *, /), comparison (=, >, <, >=, <=, <>), and logical (AND, OR, NOT).
  - NULL FUNCTIONS: Functions to handle or check for NULL values, such as IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, COALESCE, NULLIF.
- Joins
  - Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
  - JOINS: General category of operations that combine rows from multiple tables.
  - INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
  - OUTER JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in one of the tables.
  - LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table.
  - RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.
  - SELF JOIN: Joins a table with itself.
  - CROSS JOIN: Returns the Cartesian product of two tables (i.e., all combinations of rows)
- Set Operations
  - These operations are used to combine results from multiple queries.
  - UNION: Combines the results of two or more SELECT queries, removing duplicates.
  - UNION ALL: Combines the results of two or more SELECT queries, including duplicates.
- Conditional Expressions
  - CASE: Allows conditional logic within a query to return different values based on conditions (similar to an IF-ELSE statement).
- Aliases
  - ALIASES: Renaming a table or column temporarily in the query for readability or convenience. (AS keyword is used).
