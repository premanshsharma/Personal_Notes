    - Two level
    - Tree structures
  - File Operations
  - File Allocation
    - Contiguous Allocation
    - Linked Allocation
    - Indexed Allocation
- I/O Management
  - Device Drivers: Interface between OS and hardware.
  - I/O Scheduling: Determines the order of I/O requests.
  - Buffering: Temporary storage for I/O operations.
  - Spooling: Overlapping I/O and CPU processing.
- Storage Management
  - Primary Storage: RAM.
  - Secondary Storage: Hard Disk, SSD.
  - Tertiary Storage: External drives, cloud storage.
  - Disk Scheduling Algorithms:
    - FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN.
- Security and Protection
  - User Authentication: Passwords, biometrics.
  - Access Control: Who can access what?
  - Encryption: Data protection through encoding.
  - Security Threats: Viruses, Malware, Trojan Horses.
- Virtualization
  - Virtual Machines: Running multiple OS on one physical machine.
  - Hypervisors:
    - Type 1: Runs directly on hardware.
    - Type 2: Runs on a host OS.
