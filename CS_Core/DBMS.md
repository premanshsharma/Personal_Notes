# 3. Database Design
- Database design defines how data will be stored, organized, and managed in a database. It ensures data is structured efficiently and can be accessed and manipulated effectively.
- **Data Model:** Collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints.

## 3.1 Schema
- **Definition:** A schema is the blueprint or structure of a database. It defines the tables, fields (columns), and relationships between them.
  - A schema is the structure or layout of the entire database. It defines how the database is organized, what tables it contains, what fields are in each table, and how they are related. Essentially, it's the blueprint of the database.
  - **Tables** in a schema represent real-world entities, while columns (also called fields or attributes) represent the properties of those entities.

### 1. Entity
- An entity in an ER diagram represents a real-world object or concept that has significance in the system and can be stored in the database. Entities are represented by rectangles.
- Types of Entities:
  - Strong Entity:
    - Can exist independently and has a primary key that uniquely identifies it.
    - Example: A Customer in an online shopping system is a strong entity because it can be uniquely identified using a customer_id.
  - Weak Entity:
    - Cannot exist without being related to another entity. It relies on a strong entity for its existence and is identified using a partial key along with the primary key of the strong entity.
    - Example: An OrderItem in a shopping system is a weak entity because it cannot exist without an Order. The OrderItem is identified by combining order_id and item_id.
- Entity Example:
  - Entities: Customer, Order
  - Customer can have attributes like customer_id, name, email.
  - Order can have attributes like order_id, order_date.
### 2. Attributes
- Attributes are properties or characteristics of an entity. They are represented by ovals connected to their respective entities with lines.
- Types of Attributes:
  - Simple Attribute: Holds a single value for an entity (e.g., name, email).
  - Composite Attribute: Can be divided into smaller sub-parts (e.g., an address can be broken down into street, city, zip_code).
  - Multi-valued Attribute: Can hold multiple values for an entity (e.g., a phone_numbers attribute can hold more than one value).
  - Derived Attribute: A value that can be calculated from other attributes (e.g., age can be derived from birthdate).
- Attribute Example:
  - For the Customer entity:
  - Simple Attributes: name, email, customer_id.
  - Composite Attribute: address (can be split into street, city, zip_code).
  - Multi-valued Attribute: phone_numbers (a customer may have multiple phone numbers).
### 3. Relationships
- A relationship is an association between two or more entities. Relationships are represented by diamonds in ER diagrams. The entities involved in the relationship are connected to the diamond with lines.
- Types of Relationships:
  - One-to-One (1:1): One entity instance in a table is related to exactly one entity instance in another table. Example: Each Person has one Passport, and each Passport is assigned to one Person.
  - One-to-Many (1: M): One entity instance in a table is related to many entity instances in another table. Example: One Customer can place multiple Orders, but each order belongs to only one customer.
  - Many-to-One (M:1): Many instances of one entity are associated with one instance of another entity. Example: Many Orders may be placed by the same Customer.
  - Many-to-Many (M: M): Many instances of an entity are associated with many instances of another entity. Example: Many Students can enroll in many Courses, and many Courses can have many Students.
- Relationship Example:
  - Entities: Customer, Order.
  - Relationship: Places (A Customer places an Order).

### 4. Cardinality and Participation
- Cardinality
  - Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with each instance of another entity in a relationship. Participation determines whether all instances of an entity must participate in a relationship.
  - Cardinality Examples:
    - One-to-One (1:1): Each Employee has one Workstation.
    - One-to-Many (1:M): A Customer can place multiple Orders.
    - Many-to-One (M:1): Many Orders are linked to one Customer.
    - Many-to-Many (M:M): Students enroll in multiple Courses, and Courses have many Students.
- Participation Types:
  - Total Participation: Every instance of the entity must be involved in the relationship. Example: Every Order must be placed by a Customer, so the Order has total participation in the Places relationship.
  - Partial Participation: Only some instances of the entity may be involved in the relationship. Example: Not every Customer places an Order, so the Customer has partial participation in the Places relationship.

## 3.3 Relational Model
- It structures data into tables (also called relations), where each table is made up of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). This model forms the basis of most modern databases (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle) and provides a straightforward way to organize and manipulate data.

### 3.3.1 Basic Concepts of the Relational Model
- Relation (Table): A relation is essentially a table in the database. It consists of rows and columns. Each relation represents a set of related data. For example, a "Student" table would store data related to students.
- Tuple (Row): A tuple is a single row in a table, representing one record or data entry. Example: A single row in a "Student" table may represent one studentâ€™s details (like student_id, name, email).
- Attribute (Column): An attribute is a column in a table, representing a property of the entity that the table stores. Example: In the "Student" table, attributes might include student_id, name, email, etc.
- Domain: A domain is a set of permissible values for a given attribute. It defines the type and range of data that can be entered in that column.
Example: The domain of the age attribute in a "Student" table might be integers between 1 and 120.
### 3.3.2 Characteristics of a Relational Table
- Each row is unique: No two rows in a table are identical, ensuring that each tuple can be uniquely identified.
- The order of rows does not matter: The relational model does not rely on the order of rows; they can be displayed in any order without affecting the integrity of the data.
- The order of columns does not matter: The order of attributes in the table does not matter. As long as the data is associated with the correct column, the table remains valid.
- All values are atomic: Each attribute in a table contains a single value. This is known as the atomicity property, which means that a field should not contain multiple values (e.g., a single cell should not hold multiple email addresses).
### 3.3.3 Keys in the Relational Model
- Keys are crucial in the relational model because they ensure data integrity and help establish relationships between tables.
- Type of Keys
  - Primary Key: A primary key is an attribute (or set of attributes) that uniquely identifies each tuple (row) in a relation (table). Example: In a "Student" table, the student_id is the primary key because each student has a unique ID.
  - Foreign Key: A foreign key is an attribute in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables. Example: An order table might have a customer_id that references the primary key customer_id in the "Customer" table. This ensures that each order is linked to an existing customer.
  - Candidate Key: A candidate key is an attribute (or set of attributes) that could potentially serve as the primary key. If a table has multiple candidate keys, one is selected as the primary key.
  - Composite Key: A composite key is a combination of two or more attributes that, together, uniquely identify a tuple. Example: In a "Course_Registration" table, where no single attribute can uniquely identify a row, a combination of student_id and course_id might serve as the composite key.
### 3.3.4. Relationships Between Tables
- In the relational model, relationships between tables are established using foreign keys. These relationships allow the data in one table to be connected to data in another.
- Types of Relationships:
  - One-to-One (1:1): Each row in one table is related to only one row in another table. Example: A "Person" table and a "Passport" table where each person has only one passport.
  - One-to-Many (1:M): One row in one table is related to multiple rows in another table. Example: A "Customer" can place multiple "Orders", but each order belongs to only one customer.
  - Many-to-Many (M:M): Rows in one table are related to multiple rows in another table, and vice versa. Example: A "Student" can enroll in many "Courses", and each "Course" can have many "Students". This relationship is typically modeled using a third table (called a junction or associative table), such as "Student_Course".
### 3.3.5. Integrity Rules
- To maintain the consistency and accuracy of data, the relational model enforces certain integrity constraints:
- **Entity Integrity:**
  - Ensures that the primary key of a table is unique and not null. This ensures that each record in a table can be uniquely identified.
  - Example: A "Student" tableâ€™s primary key student_id cannot have duplicates or null values.
- **Referential Integrity:**
  - Ensures that a foreign key value in one table must match a primary key value in another table, or it must be null.
  - Example: If a customer_id in the "Order" table references a customer_id in the "Customer" table, it must match an existing customer or be null.

### 3.3.6 Advantages of the Relational Model
- Simplicity: Easy to understand and use with clearly defined tables, columns, and relationships.
- Data Integrity: Enforces strict rules (like primary and foreign keys) to ensure data accuracy.
- Flexibility: Can handle complex relationships between data and allows easy querying through SQL.
- Normalization: Supports normalization to remove redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Scalability: Well-suited for scaling large databases with millions of records.
